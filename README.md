# Reefer Raker
An application to track moving boxes into the reefers

During the pandemic the campus has had to deal with more samples than ever before. We are now processing 20000 samples a week.

The problem is where to store them and how to keep track of them? We donâ€™t have enough freezer space in our buildings so we now have 5 large -20C refrigerated units called reefers which are in the campus car park. Once the samples have been sequenced they need to be moved but we also need to make sure we can find out where they are.

Currently this is done with existing software, spreadsheets and manual checking. It is time consuming and easy to make mistakes especially when our staff are working in cold conditions.

All of the samples are stored in plates with a unique barcode. We have 80 plates in a box and that box also has a barcode. We need to build them an application that allows them to scan those barcodes and store the location. They also need to be able to double check that they are putting them in the right place. 

This would make the jobs of the reefer teams much easier as well as allowing us to find out where they are. Imagine trying to find a sample amongst thousands of other samples by hand. It would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack!

# Building and running reefer raker locally

Building and running Reefer Raker in your local environment is very easy. You will need access to the command line and be sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and then follow the directions below:

1. Clone the source code

git clone https://github.com/wgc-hackathon/reefer-raker-dhtml.git

2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned it to and double click on the index.html file.

## If you don't have access to the command line?

1. Click on the green 'code' button and select 'download.zip'

2. Download the zip to your PC, unzip it and save the files somewhere.

3. Navigate to the folder where you saved it to and double click on the index.html file.

# To start coding

1. You will need either a text editor e.g. Notepad or Notepad++ or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). These are all free!

2. Navigate to the issues page https://github.com/wgc-hackathon/reefer-raker-dhtml/issues

3. Start coding! Each of the issues will tell you what you need to do with a list of steps that it is best to follow in order. There are also some tips and hints to get started.

4. To get the best out of this exercise you should try it in order. Start with page 1, then page 2 and so on. Also within each page try the tasks in order. You will find that each task follows on from the previous one and they get progressively more difficult.
